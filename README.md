# Tableau-Dashboards
Tableau Dashboards mark the MSA and Non-MSA regions for all the US regions. The location information is extracted and mapped to their counties for the job listings and candidate profile from USAJOBS, Indeed and LinkedIn. These counties are mapped to the MSA and Non MSA regions marked in the map. A cross tab view showing detailed information on the number of job postings and the position title for each state and MSA /Non-MSA regions is also presented. The code repo contains supporting data files for Dashboard and the Location to County mapping scripts for the job listings and candidate profiles.
